# Docker - An Introduction and Installation Guide

Docker and containerization are terms that you hear very frequently in the industry these days. Essentially, containers ease the shipping of your application from a development environment to a production environment. One issue often encountered during the development of any application is that the application fails in the testing/pre-production (also referred to as "staging") environments due to underlying differnces in software packages, version mismatches and such. (If you have heard the words "But it works on my machine!" then this is exactly what I'm talking about.) Docker helps you (as a developer) build, test and ship the application from your development environment to a production environment with relative ease.

But before we extol the virtues of Docker and go into how Docker achieves all this, let's first go back in time and see what prompted the idea of containerization.

### From virtualization to containerization

#### Virtualization

Suppose you own a laptop that runs a Windows operating system, and at work you are asked to develop an application that runs on a Linux operating system. One way to do this is to use a virtual machine. According to VMWare, "Aâ€¯Virtual Machine (VM) is a compute resource that uses software instead of a physical computer to run programs and deploy apps". In other words, rather than setting up a dual-boot on your laptop, you can now run an application on your Windows OS that acts just like a real Linux OS.

Such VMs rely on a hypervisor (eg. VirtualBox), which takes care of ensuring a sufficient amount of CPU, RAM, disk storage are available for the VM's OS to run. In fact, a copy of the Linux OS is installed on a virtual disk and the VM thus created can be used like any other Linux machine. Since a copy of the OS is installed, this makes VMs bulky and difficult to ship. This limitation led to the idea of containerization.

#### Containerization

As seens above, virtualization lets you host a Linux OS on your laptop running a Windows OS. But this does not make the deployment of your application on a production environment easy, since shipping the whole Linux VM you worked on is cumbersome. Imagine if you could remove the bulk from the VM, which is attributed to the OS. This is exactly what a Docker engine achieves. 

The docker containers contain only what is absolutely essential to run your application and it shares the OS kernel of your laptop (VMs do not share the host OS kernel). As a result, the docker containers are light-weight and easy to ship to production environments. The key differences between virtual machines and docker containers is shown in the figure below, sourced from Simplilearn Docker tutorials.

Now that we understand why containerization helps, let us move onto some of the concepts and terminology often encountered in the world of Docker.

### Terminology

#### Docker Image
Suppose you have to build a web application for your IT5007 course. As a developer, you want to install a certain version of NPM and some other packages on an Ubuntu server version 18.04. Of course you would like it if the NPM packages, other dependencies and your code all work in the latest version of NPM/the latest version of Ubuntu (say 20.04). But, you do not have the time to test everything on the Ubuntu 20.04. You decide to instead ship the Docker container you have been working on while developing the application. To ship this container, docker images come in handy.

A docker image is like a snapshot of what was in the container until that point in time. Your image would then contain not just the base OS Ubuntu 18.04 but also the NPM packages, dependent packages and so on. Docker images are usually created layer by layer, with the base layer usually being the OS of choice with other layers that eventually help build back the original container you were working on. Docker Hub is aa repository that allows you to share these images with other team mates in your project group or to the public.

#### Docker container
A docker container can be thought of as a running instance of an image. Analogous to Object Oriented Programming, if a docker image is a class definition, a container is an instance of the docker image class. This contains the executable code and acts like a stand-alone machine. It contains the code, libraries, system tools that are needed to run your application.

For your IT5007 web application, you could have the code and associated libraries packaged as an image, "spin up" (another word for instance creation in the Docker context) containers and just start the application as an executable command. Since the Docker image is built from the container on your laptop, it behaves the same on anyone else's device too. This even lets you spin up the container on a Linux OS, or even another Windows OS laptop.

#### Docker Networking
Every process you start on your device runs on a specific port. For example, when you started your IT5007 node js server, it would have started on port 3000. You would have later accessed the web application from your laptop using the URL http://localhost:3000/. If you set up your web application within a Docker container and start the node js server there with the same configuration, it would run on port 3000 there as well.

The point to remember is that now, port 3000 is the one on the Docker container, not on your laptop. Remember the docker container acts like it's a separate device isolated from your laptop. This means now trying to access http://localhost:3000/ on your laptop  would not show what is happening within the container. To access what is going on within the container, you need to "map" port 3000 of your laptop (or even some other port of your choice) to port 3000 of your container. We shall see how to achieve this in the following sections.

### Docker Installation on Windows
Now that we have covered some of the conceptual parts of Docker, let us start working with it. In this section, we cover the installation of Docker Desktop on a Windows laptop. This section is based on https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/. For other OS, please refer to the instructions on https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/ (for Mac OS) or https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/ (for Linux OS). 

#### Pre-requisite
Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 (WSL2) is needed as the backend for Docker Desktop installation. Docker uses some features provided by Linux which would not be available on a Windows OS laptop. To allow these features to be available to Docker, we install WSL2.
We will be following the manual installation steps on https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual.

- Enable WSL first, by launching Powershell as administrator, and running the following command:
```dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart```
- Enable the Virtual Machine feature by running the following command on Powershell as administrator.
```dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart```
- Once the command above runs successfully, restart your laptop.
- After the restart, download the WSL2 package for x64 machines from the link https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi and double click the download to start the installation. Click on the default prompts to complete the installation.
- To set the default version to 2, run the following command as adminsitrator on Powershell
```wsl --set-default-version 2```

#### Installing Docker Desktop
- After installing and enabling WSL2, download the Docker Desktop executable from https://desktop.docker.com/win/main/amd64/Docker%20Desktop%20Installer.exe
- Double click the file to start the installation, leave the defaults on as is and complete the installation.
- Search for Docker Desktop under the Start menu and launch Docker Desktop. Ensure the engine starts successfully.
