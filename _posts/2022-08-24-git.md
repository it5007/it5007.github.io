# Git

## Why should we use version control systems?

Commonly, prior to using a version control system, we would use some form of
file naming system to let us know which version a file belongs to, and which
file is the latest and most updated file we have.

Imagine that you were working on a project and had some code that you are
working on for submission. It could look like:

```
projects
|
+- IT5007_homework_one
   |
   + working_version1.js
   + working_version2.js
   + final_version.js
```

This allows for some form of record history to let you know which files came
first and so on, but if you were to want to know quickly what differences
exist between `working_version2.js` `final_version.js`? Additionally, this
file naming system would be a standard that you would have to share with anyone
you are working with. (What if they too had their own `final_version.js`).

Git solves these problems by providing a standard for version control with
functionality to save a history of snapshots for projects and other useful
metadata.

Perhaps, you were looking at two previous snapshots, one where you saved the
version of code that was `working_version2.js` and one that was
`final_version.js`. With Git, you could check the commit message for these
snapshots and get a quick overview of why certain parts of your code was changed
and for what reason. (Well, we assume that you write good commit messages! ðŸ˜Ž)

Another example of Git's functionality that cannot be easily replicated by the
above file naming system is the ability to create **branches** that allow
separate lines of development to occur in parallel. For example, you discovered
a bug fix, and concurrently, your co-worker would like to develop a new feature.
Both of you could branch of the current snapshot and then merge your branches
back in later.

## How Git's data model works

Before we look into the functional interface of Git, it's important to first
layout the data model of Git and how snapshots are created and stored.

Some terminology:
- "blob" -> a common term for a file (or a bunch of bytes)
- "tree" -> a directory (or folder)
- "snapshot" -> the top level tree that is being tracked by Git

### Example (taken from [missing_semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)):
```
<root> (tree)
|
+- foo (tree)
|  |
|  + bar.txt (blob, contents = "hello world")
|
+- baz.txt (blob, contents = "git is wonderful")
```

In this example, we have a top-level tree that contains two elements, a tree
(foo) and a blob (baz.txt).

### Snapshots
Git's data model records snapshots in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
What this means is that each snapshot has a set of snapshots that precede it,
i.e. a set of parent nodes. Since it is not necessarily a linear history, there
exists a possibility that a snapshot could have been created as the child of two
different parent snapshots (this occurs when merging two parallel branches of
development).

```
o <-- o <-- o
      ^
       \
        --- o <-- o
```

In this ASCII art, the `<--` defines a **comes-before** relation, where the `o`
being pointed to by the arrow indicates the parent node, and the node on the
right of the arrow indicates the child node. As such, what the above graph
depicts is a history of snapshots that branched into two separate branches after
the second commit.

Once these two branches of development are to be linked back together, they may
be merged back together, resulting in a graph that looks like this:

```
o <-- o <-- o <---- o
      ^            /
       \          v
        --- o <-- o
```

### Pseudocode for Git's data model
Adapted from [missing_semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/version-control/)

At this point, we have a rough idea of what snapshots a.k.a. commits are in Git
and how branches can be created and then merged together. We now look at the
data stored by Git and what a rough model of it looks like!

```
// a file is a bunch of bytes
type blob = array<byte>

// a directory contains named files and directories
type tree = map<string, tree | blob>

// a commit has parents, metadata, and the top-level tree
type commit = struct {
    parents: array<commit>
    author: string
    message: string
    snapshot: tree
}
```

As previously defined, a `blob` is essentially a bunch of bytes, and hence, can
be stored as an array of bytes. A `tree` can be thought of as a set of mappings
from `strings` to `tree`s or `blob`s. For a commit, it would then have a set of
parents, which can be stored as an `array` of commits; an author, a message, and
the ...
